                                Founded by
                                LoneVVolf,
                                also known as Estevan Lerma, the group was created back in 2017.
                                Everything first began in <font color="cyan" face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Roblox</i></font>,
                                a
                                free website
                                with
                                games that also allows you to create games for free. Being intrigued with Lua coding,
                                the
                                main language
                                to
                                code games in Roblox, LoneVVolf began to create whatever fascinating ideas came to
                                thought.
                                From building a tree to a skyscraper. This is where his coding career began. Soon after,
                                he
                                founded
                                LoneVVolf studios to generate a source of income from his creations.
                                Years later, he applied to <i>
                                    <font color="purple" face="Comic Sans MS">Grand Canyon University</font>
                                </i>, hoping to expand his career to other coding languages.
                                His end goal, being, to spread his creations worldwide.

                                Programming isn't the only thing LoneVVolf Studios knows how to do. In fact,
                                LoneVVolf studios is capable of
                                video editing. Using <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="cyan"><i>Adobe Premiere Pro

                                LoneVVolf studios to create amazing videos. Such as the examples to the right. On

                                place. Both
                                videos were creating using Premiere Pro and
                                Photoshop. Footage was captured from in game graphics created by LoneVVolf Studios
                                in Roblox. Both videos are outro footages for LoneVVolf's youtube channel. If you're
